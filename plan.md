📋 4. Features with User Stories
🎮 Core User Stories
[Player]
As a player, I can join a quiz via room code

I can enter my name before joining

I receive the current question in real-time

I can answer within the time limit

I see if I got it right or wrong

[Host]
I can create a room and get a room code

I can input questions and correct answers

I can view connected players

I can start and advance the quiz

I can see the live scoreboard

🔧 5. Technical Architecture (Real-Time Flow)
text
Copy
Edit
Client (Player or Host) ←→ Socket.IO ←→ Node.js Server (Memory Room State)
                                                  ↑
                                                  └─ REST API (for future expansion / quiz upload)
Socket.IO handles all real-time syncing.

Room states are stored in memory (Map or RoomManager class).

Players join rooms → emit join_room → server stores them → broadcast player_joined.

⚙️ 6. Backend Service Design
Sockets
Event	Direction	Purpose
join_room	Client → Server	Join room with name + code
player_joined	Server → Host	Notify host someone joined
start_game	Host → Server	Begin the quiz
question	Server → All	Send question to all players
submit_answer	Player → Server	Answer the current question
score_update	Server → All	Broadcast current scores
end_game	Host → Server	Finish the quiz session

🧪 7. Testing Plan
✅ Manual Test Cases
Join game with multiple players

Start game and sync question to all

Answer within time limit

Verify score calculation

🧪 Load Test
Use Artillery to simulate 300 WebSocket clients

Validate server doesn’t drop connections

🧪 8. Deployment Plan
Service	Stack	Setup
Frontend	React + Vite	Vercel
Backend	Node + Socket.IO	Fly.io or Railway (WebSocket-ready)
Domain	.fly.dev or vercel.app	Custom if needed

📄 9. Docs You’ll Create
/docs/ or in README.md
README.md: overview, setup, run instructions

architecture.md: real-time flow diagrams

features.md: user stories + socket table

deployment.md: how to deploy on Fly/Vercel

stress-testing.md: how to run Artillery tests

🧰 10. Dev Tools & Git Strategy
Git Branching (Solo Dev)

Edit
main            ← production-ready code
dev             ← active work
feature/join-ui ← per-feature branches
Use pull requests to merge feature/* into dev, then dev into main for release.
