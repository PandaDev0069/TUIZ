### Progress
 - [x] 2025-08-14: Wired host CSS to inherit universal theme/animations. Updated files: frontend/src/styles/host/host-variables.css, host-animations.css, host-components.css, host-responsive.css. Why: centralize tokens and ensure consistent theming. Next: audit host pages to remove any redundant hardcoded colors and rely on CSS variables; verify animations respect reduced-motion.
 - [x] 2025-08-14: Aligned host color scheme with universal (primary/secondary mapped to tuiz primary/purple). Simplified interactive colors via color-mix; removed redundant --host-primary-rgb. Next: replace any remaining hard-coded colors in host-* with host variables.
  - Files: `frontend/src/styles/player/player-variables.css`, `frontend/src/styles/player/player-components.css`, `frontend/src/styles/player/player-animations.css`, `frontend/src/pages/WaitingRoom.jsx`
 - [x] 2025-08-14: HostLobby shows "player left" lines in terminal when users disconnect
   - Files: `frontend/src/pages/HostLobby.jsx`, `frontend/src/pages/hostLobby.css`
   - Why: Improve host awareness of live player changes; mirrors existing playerJoined terminal lines
   - Next: Persist terminal log with capped length and auto-scroll; unify terminal feed (join/leave/system) with icons

### Juy 2025
- [x] **Database Migration** - Updated schema for better performance
- [x] **Socket.IO Integration** - Real-time communication improvements
- [x] **Question Format Adapter** - Better question type handling
