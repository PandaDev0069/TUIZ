# üéØ Quiz System Development Roadmap

## üìä Project Overview

**Goal**: Transform the current quiz system from file-based to full database integration with modern features including images, explanations, and comprehensive game settings.

**Current Status**: Basic functionality working with `questions.json`, needs complete refactor for database integration.

**Estimated Timeline**: 15-18 days (3 weeks)

## üîç Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Working
- [x] Authentication System (Supabase)
- [x] Database Schema (Complete with relationships)
- [x] Game Settings System (CRUD for question_sets.play_settings)
- [x] Room Management (RoomManager handles sessions)
- [x] Socket.IO Communication (Real-time lobby/game events)
- [x] Question Builder UI (With image upload support)
- [x] Game Lobby Flow (Host lobby + player waiting room)
- [x] Basic Quiz Interface (Question display and answer submission)

### ‚ùå Critical Issues
- [ ] **Database Integration Gap**: Using `questions.json` instead of database
- [ ] **Schema Mismatch**: Quiz expects old format vs database structure
- [ ] **Game Settings Not Applied**: Settings saved but not used in game flow
- [ ] **Image Support Missing**: No image rendering in quiz interface
- [ ] **Explanation System Missing**: No explanation display system
- [ ] **Question Types Mismatch**: Hardcoded vs database enum types

## üîß Technical Implementation Details

### Database Query Strategy
```sql
-- Single optimized query for game loading
SELECT 
  q.id,
  q.question_text,
  q.question_type,
  q.image_url,
  q.time_limit,
  q.points,
  q.order_index,
  q.explanation_title,
  q.explanation_text,
  q.explanation_image_url,
  array_agg(
    json_build_object(
      'id', a.id,
      'text', a.answer_text,
      'image_url', a.image_url,
      'is_correct', a.is_correct,
      'order_index', a.order_index
    ) ORDER BY a.order_index
  ) as answers
FROM questions q
LEFT JOIN answers a ON q.id = a.question_id
WHERE q.question_set_id = $1
GROUP BY q.id
ORDER BY q.order_index;
```

### Settings Integration Pattern
```javascript
const applyGameSettings = (settings, baseQuestion) => {
  return {
    ...baseQuestion,
    timeLimit: settings.useCustomTiming ? 
      settings.questionTime * 1000 : 
      baseQuestion.time_limit * 1000,
    showExplanation: settings.showExplanations,
    explanationDuration: settings.explanationTime * 1000,
    pointsMultiplier: settings.pointCalculation === 'time-bonus' ? 1.5 : 1.0
  };
};
```

### Question Type Mapping
```javascript
const QUESTION_TYPES = {
  DATABASE_TO_GAME: {
    'multiple_choice': 'multiple_choice_4',
    'true_false': 'true_false',
    'free_text': 'free_text'
  },
  GAME_TO_DATABASE: {
    'multiple_choice_4': 'multiple_choice',
    'multiple_choice_2': 'multiple_choice',
    'true_false': 'true_false'
  }
};
```
