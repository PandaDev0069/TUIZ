## UI Change ##
# Host ui
- the connected players are showing too slowly (参加しました) shows fast but the player name takes too long , no need of animation there

the host score board the it shows the analysis needs update to work with the mulple types of question.

the anwer percentage is showin 100% (but some of the playes didnt answer due to time over)

# Player ui
- intermediate ui change = the player [ #1 - Player name    {score } ] this should be the box layout
and if overflowed the player self's ranks name and score should be shown in the bottom 5th place insead of the 5th person. The up arrow for the rank up is not working .


- the last player who joined the room , the player count is not showing for that player

- Remove 正解　and 不正解　from o , X question and just put LArge O and X only for proper visibility.

- remove the sparking for displaying streak in the inter-scoreboard
